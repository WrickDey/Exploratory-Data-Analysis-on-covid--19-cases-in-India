# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-covid--19-cases-in-India
COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented global health crisis in the last 100 years. Its economic, social and health impact continues to grow and is likely to end up as one of the worst global disasters since the 1918 pandemic and the World Wars. Mathematical models have played an important role in the ongoing crisis; they have been used to inform public policies and have been instrumental in many of the social distancing measures that were instituted worldwide. In this work, I performed analysis on latest Indian state wise covid-1 data of using important Exploratory Data Analysis techniques to find important findings and arrive at conclusions based on them, so that we can make important decisions.






The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is the most significant pandemic since
the 1918 Influenza pandemic. It has already caused over 21 Million
confirmed cases and 758,000 deaths.
1 The economic impact is already in
trillions of dollars. As in other pandemics, researchers and public health
policy makers are interested in questions such as,
2
(i) How did it start? (ii)
How is it likely to progress and how can we control it? (iii) Which states
having large population handled their situation well? (iv) How related
active cases and deaths in a state were? (v) Which states had largest death
cases?
To answer these questions we leverage EDA which as defined by Tukey in 1961
as:
"Procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such
procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more
precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical)
statistics which apply to analyzing data."
[
We perform EDA on a dataset containing current data on covid-19 from
https://www.mohfw.gov.in/ and uncover hidden insights regarding the
spread of the disease, through extensive studies and visualizations.





We have considered the dataset on current covid-19 scenario as of May 22,
2022 taken from https://www.mohfw.gov.in/ which shows statewise covid19 data .
